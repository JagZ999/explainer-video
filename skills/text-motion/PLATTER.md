# The Motion Platter — named recipe catalog

A menu of motion-graphics "moves" distilled from launch-reel / SaaS-promo references
(Pinterest "2d motion graphics", "saas promotional video", Beyond Motion, Zelios, think3,
MotionDesigners.Pro, Nadim Sheikh, Philipp, Behance). Each has a **name**, what it looks
like, the **reference** it came from, and a **render-safe build** (works in the headless-Edge
capture pipeline — see the blur rule at the bottom). Helpers live in `assets/textmotion.js`;
classes in `assets/textmotion.css`.

> When the user asks for "the platter" or "a platter of skills," list these names grouped by
> family with the one-line look, and offer to wire any subset into their piece.

## Extra background/element variants ✳
- **B6 · Starfield Drift** — tiny dots twinkle + parallax (ref: "Alpha" crypto promo) → `.tm-stars`+`tmStars`.
- **C8 · Line-Draw Icon** — an icon strokes itself on (`stroke-dashoffset`) → `.tm-draw`.
- **C9 · Doodle Connector** ✳ — wobbly hand-drawn line links two elements (ref: Kitaabh collage) → `.tm-draw` on a hand-jittered path.
- **G8 · Timeline Scrubber** ✳ — a horizontal date axis with a playhead sliding through years (ref: Kitaabh) → `.tm-timeline`+`tmScrub`.
- **B7 · Texture Overlay** ✳ — a persistent grain / paper / halftone / paint-wash layer over the whole frame for a tactile, "designed" feel (ref: Zelios/Canny painterly showreel; collage halftone) → `.tm-grainwrap` (SVG fractal-noise, static — cheap) + `.tm-halftone` + optional slow-drifting soft color wash. Keep opacity low (.04–.12). *Grain is a static overlay so it's render-cheap; do NOT animate it with `filter`.*

## H · Aesthetic presets (whole-scene looks, from the "What a Story" playlist) ✳
These are *combinations* — a background + element + type recipe that reads as one style.
| # | Name | The recipe | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | **Isometric UI** | UI planes on `rotateX(55deg) rotateZ(-45deg)`, layered + floating, soft long shadow; charts/cards animate on the plane | "Viable" #27 |
| H2 | **Collage / Cutout** | flat color bg + photographic cutouts + torn-paper sticker badges + **doodle connectors** + halftone/paper texture + timeline | "Kitaabh" #72 |
| H3 | **Apple-Minimalist** | huge negative space, ONE shape/word, slow elegant eases, mono/light type, near-black or near-white field | "Apple-Style" #94 |
| H4 | **Crypto / Neon-Glow** | near-black bg + starfield/particles + neon-glow edges + a spinning 3D token/coin + grid horizon | "Alpha" #2, "Ultra.io" NFT drops |
| H5 | **Dashboard Reveal** | a product UI window rises in (UI-Screen-Reveal) then its charts grow, counters tick, rows deal in | most SaaS explainers |

*Playlist coverage:* both "What a Story" playlists (~99 + ~97, heavily overlapping — same studio/clients) sort into ~7 buckets — **2D SaaS explainer** (the majority: kinetic type + UI cards + gradients + transitions), **Dashboard/data-viz + infographic** (H5 + family G), **Isometric** (H1), **Collage** (H2), **Crypto/NFT neon** (H4), **Apple-minimalist abstract** (H3), and **3D** (H1/`.tm-spin3d`/`.tm-iso` cover 3D-lite). All are reproducible in-pipeline with families A–G + these presets.

**Out of scope for the HTML/CSS render pipeline** (present in the playlists, but *not* achievable with this toolkit — flag to the user and use real footage / AE / a video model instead): **rigged 2D character animation**, **live-action footage**, and **true 3D scenes** (only 3D-lite via CSS transforms is in-pipeline).

✳ = added in this pass (the rest already shipped in the skill).

## Families at a glance (the "platter")
**A** Text entrances · **B** Backgrounds & gradients · **C** Shapes/orbs/particles ·
**D** Glass & UI accents · **E** Product & composition · **F** Scene transitions · **G** UI & data motion.
~40 named moves. Ask for "the platter" to get this menu; ask for a family letter to get just those.

## Render-safety rule (applies to every recipe)
Headless Edge software-rasterizes `filter:blur()` / `backdrop-filter:blur()` → capture drops to
~5 fps. So every "soft/frosted/blurred" look here is faked **without** blur:
- **Softness** → `radial-gradient` falloff (rings, orbs, bokeh) or low-opacity layers.
- **Frosted glass** → semi-transparent gradient fill + 1px light border + inset top highlight (no backdrop-filter).
- **Motion blur** → a short directional `text-shadow`/ghost smear that resolves to none (`tmBlurIn`), not `filter:blur`.
- **Metaball goo** → two circles + a rounded connecting bar (no SVG `feGaussianBlur` goo filter).
All time-driven helpers take **logical time `t`** and all CSS durations scale by `--R`, so motion
stays correct under slow-clock capture.

## A′ · Line dynamics (added from the ETF launch-cut build, Jul 2026)
Whole-LINE behaviors — the line moves as one object, not word-by-word.
| # | Name | Looks like | Build |
|---|---|---|---|
| A11 | **Stamp-Slam** | line slams in like an auditor's stamp (scale 1.55→1 + tilt) | `.tm-stamp`+`.hit` |
| A12 | **Split-Converge** | two halves slide from opposite sides, meet with overshoot | `.tm-half.l/.r`+`.in` |
| A13 | **CRT Flicker-On** | line boots like a terminal (two flickers, then solid) | `.tm-crt`+`.on` |
| A14 | **Tracking-Breathe** | kicker settles from very wide letter-spacing | `.tm-breathe`+`.in` |
| A15 | **Strike-Dismiss** | superseded line gets struck through + dims (pairs with cracked-word) | `.tm-dismiss`+`.struck` |
| A16 | **Cipher-Slot** | ONE word in a stable sentence churns ciphertext then resolves | width-locked slot (see rule below) |
| — | **Living text** | shimmer / breathe / word wave-bob / glow pulse / perpetual ticker keep text alive after entrances | `.tm-shimmer` `.tm-pulse` + JS bob |
| — | **Camera Waypoints** | multi-target zoom choreography (terminal → dashboard → receipt) | waypoint array + easeIO lerp in camFor |

## Production rules (paid for in re-renders — do not relearn)
1. **Width-lock scramble slots.** Cipher glyphs vary in width → the whole sentence reflows every cycle and "the words move." Lock the slot to the EXACT resolved-word width, measured via a hidden clone appended to the heading (live-element measures can return 0 pre-layout; retry per-frame until >0; avoid unit-guess fallbacks — an oversized fallback = visible extra gaps around the word).
2. **Motion-blur smear ≤ .15em.** Bigger text-shadow offsets read as DUPLICATE words at hero sizes, not blur.
3. **One static stage background.** Never composite bright backgrounds inside the camera-transformed world — any pan/zoom can expose the world edge (black border). Put a single oversized static background UNDER the world; only elements ride the camera.
4. **Neutral logo shadows.** Colored drop-shadows (purple/mint) around white lockups read as color bleed/fringing. Use dark neutral shadows on brand marks.
5. **Transform states must carry positioning.** If an element is centered by `translateX(-50%)`, every animation state (including JS-set transforms like breathing) must include it, or the element jumps half-off-screen.
6. **Cue words to the SFX events, not vice versa.** Read the sfx event JSON (tick times) and reveal each word exactly on its tick; a linear reveal window drifts ~0.3s off the sounds.
